Description: Computes optimal cutpoints for diagnostic tests or continuous markers. Various approaches for selecting optimal cutoffs have been implemented, including methods based on cost-benefit analysis and diagnostic test accuracy measures (Sensitivity/Specificity, Predictive Values and Diagnostic Likelihood Ratios). Numerical and graphical output for all methods is easily obtained.
